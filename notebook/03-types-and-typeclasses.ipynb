    "own, so we don't have to explicitly write out the types of our functions\n",

    "which category of things that expression fits. The expression `True` is a\n",
    "boolean, `\"hello\"` is a string, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll use GHCI to examine the types of some expressions. We'll do\n",
