    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually when we write mathematical expressions in school, we write them\n",
    "in an infix manner. For instance, we write `10 - (4 + 3) * 2`. `+`, `*` and\n",
    "`-` are infix operators, just like the infix functions we met in Haskell\n",
    "(`+`, `` `elem` ``, etc.). This makes it handy because we, as humans, can\n",
    "parse it easily in our minds by looking at such an expression. The\n",
    "downside to it is that we have to use parentheses to denote precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Reverse Polish\n",
    "notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) is\n",
    "another way of writing down mathematical expressions. Initially it looks\n",
    "a bit weird, but it's actually pretty easy to understand and use because\n",
    "there's no need for parentheses and it's very easy to punch into a\n",
    "calculator. While most modern calculators use infix notation, some\n",
    "people still swear by RPN calculators. This is what the previous infix\n",
    "expression looks like in RPN: `10 4 3 + 2 * -`. How do we calculate what\n",
    "the result of that is? Well, think of a stack. You go over the\n",
    "expression from left to right. Every time a number is encountered, push\n",
    "it on to the stack. When we encounter an operator, take the two numbers\n",
    "that are on top of the stack (we also say that we *pop* them), use the\n",
    "operator and those two and then push the resulting number back onto the\n",
    "stack. When you reach the end of the expression, you should be left with\n",
    "a single number if the expression was well-formed and that number\n",
    "represents the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/rpn.png\" title=\"this expression\" style=\"\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over the expression `10 4 3 + 2 * -` together! First we push `10`\n",
    "on to the stack and the stack is now `10`. The next item is `4`, so we push\n",
    "it to the stack as well. The stack is now `10, 4`. We do the same with `3`\n",
    "and the stack is now `10, 4, 3`. And now, we encounter an operator, namely\n",
    "`+`! We pop the two top numbers from the stack (so now the stack is just\n",
    "`10`), add those numbers together and push that result to the stack. The\n",
    "stack is now `10, 7`. We push `2` to the stack, the stack for now is\n",
    "`10, 7, 2`. We've encountered an operator again, so let's pop `7` and `2` off the\n",
    "stack, multiply them and push that result to the stack. Multiplying `7`\n",
    "and `2` produces a `14`, so the stack we have now is `10, 14`. Finally,\n",
    "there's a `-`. We pop `10` and `14` from the stack, subtract `14` from `10` and\n",
    "push that back. The number on the stack is now `-4` and because there are\n",
    "no more numbers or operators in our expression, that's our result!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how we'd calculate any RPN expression by hand, let's\n",
    "think about how we could make a Haskell function that takes as its\n",
    "parameter a string that contains a RPN expression, like\n",
    "`\"10 4 3 + 2 * -\"` and gives us back its result.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would the type of that function be? We want it to take a string as\n",
    "a parameter and produce a number as its result. So it will probably be\n",
    "something like `solveRPN :: (Num a) => String -> a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Protip:* it really helps to first think what the type declaration of a\n",
    "> function should be before concerning ourselves with the implementation\n",

    "\n",
    "Cool. When implementing a solution to a problem in Haskell, it's also\n",
    "good to think back on how you did it by hand and maybe try to see if you\n",
    "can gain any insight from that. Here we see that we treated every number\n",
    "or operator that was separated by a space as a single item. So it might\n",
    "help us if we start by breaking a string like\n",
    "`\"10 4 3 + 2 * -\"` into a\n",
    "list of items like `[\"10\",\"4\",\"3\",\"+\",\"2\",\"*\",\"-\"]`.\n",

    "[folds](#folds), we said that pretty much any\n",
    "function where you traverse a list from left to right or right to left\n",
    "one element by element and build up (accumulate) some result (whether\n",
    "it's a number, a list, a stack, whatever) can be implemented with a\n",
    "fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we're going to use a left fold, because we go over the\n",
    "list from left to right. The accumulator value will be our stack and\n",
    "hence, the result from the fold will also be a stack, only as we've\n",
    "seen, it will only have one item.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing to think about is, well, how are we going to represent\n",
    "the stack? I propose we use a list. Also I propose that we keep the top\n",
    "of our stack at the head of the list. That's because adding to the head\n",
    "(beginning) of a list is much faster than adding to the end of it. So if\n",
    "we have a stack of, say, `10, 4, 3`, we'll represent that as the list\n",
    "`[3,4,10]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have enough information to roughly sketch our function. It's\n",
    "going to take a string, like, `\"10 4 3 + 2 * -\"` and break it down into a\n",
    "list of items by using `words` to get `[\"10\",\"4\",\"3\",\"+\",\"2\",\"*\",\"-\"]`.\n",
    "Next, we'll do a left fold over that list and end up with a stack that\n",
    "has a single item, so `[-4]`. We take that single item out of the list and\n",
    "that's our final result!\n",
