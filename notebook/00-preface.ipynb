    "This is a Jupyter notebook adaptation of the book [__*Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!*__](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) by Miran Lipovača.\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned Haskell from this book in 2014 by following along in [GHCI](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/ghci.html), as the book suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019, the Jupyter notebook format would be a nice way read this book. This is one of the best cases for Theodore Gray's idea of the [computational essay](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/), and Andrew Gibiansky has made it possible with [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each chapter of the book is one `.ipynb` Jupyter notebook file. See the list of chapter files on the left sidebar in JupyterLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each notebook cell depends on cells that come before it, so run the notebooks from top to bottom. I have refactored code to make the examples work in Jupyter, and removed instructions for how to use GHCI. Other than that I have tried to be faithful to the original text.\n",
