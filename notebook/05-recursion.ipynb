    "the head, which is `5` and then put it in the middle of two lists that are\n",
    "smaller and bigger than it. So at one point, you'll have\n",

    "have a sorted list! We sort the two lists using the same function.\n",
    "Eventually, we'll break it up so much that we reach empty lists and an\n",
    "empty list is already sorted in a way, by virtue of being empty. Here's\n",

    "\n",
    "An element that is in place and won't move anymore is represented in\n",
    "<span style=\"color:darkorange;font-weight:bold\">orange</span>. If you read them from left to right, you'll see the sorted list.\n",
    "Although we chose to compare all the elements to the heads, we could\n",
    "have used any element to compare against. In quicksort, an element that\n",
    "you compare against is called a pivot. They're in <span style=\"color:green;font-weight:bold;\">green</span> here. We chose\n",
    "the head because it's easy to get by pattern matching. The elements that\n",
    "are smaller than the pivot are <span style=\"color:lightgreen;font-weight:bold;\">light green</span> and elements larger than the\n",

    "Thinking recursively\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We did quite a bit of recursion so far and as you've probably noticed,\n",
    "there's a pattern here. Usually you define an edge case and then you\n",
    "define a function that does something between some element and the\n",
    "function applied to the rest. It doesn't matter if it's a list, a tree\n",
    "or any other data structure. A sum is the first element of a list plus\n",
    "the sum of the rest of the list. A product of a list is the first\n",
    "element of the list times the product of the rest of the list. The\n",
    "length of a list is one plus the length of the tail of the list.\n",
    "Ekcetera, ekcetera ...\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/brain.png\" title=\"brain\" style=\"background-color:white;float:left;margin-right:2em;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, these also have edge cases. Usually the edge case is some\n",
    "scenario where a recursive application doesn't make sense. When dealing\n",
    "with lists, the edge case is most often the empty list. If you're\n",
    "dealing with trees, the edge case is usually a node that doesn't have\n",
    "any children.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's similar when you're dealing with numbers recursively. Usually it\n",
    "has to do with some number and the function applied to that number\n",
    "modified. We did the factorial function earlier and it's the product of\n",
    "a number and the factorial of that number minus one. Such a recursive\n",
    "application doesn't make sense with zero, because factorials are defined\n",
    "only for positive integers. Often the edge case value turns out to be an\n",
    "identity. The identity for multiplication is 1 because if you multiply\n",
    "something by 1, you get that something back. Also when doing sums of\n",
    "lists, we define the sum of an empty list as 0 and 0 is the identity for\n",
    "addition. In quicksort, the edge case is the empty list and the identity\n",
    "is also the empty list, because if you add an empty list to a list, you\n",
    "just get the original list back.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when trying to think of a recursive way to solve a problem, try to\n",
    "think of when a recursive solution doesn't apply and see if you can use\n",
    "that as an edge case, think about identities and think about whether\n",
    "you'll break apart the parameters of the function (for instance, lists\n",
    "are usually broken into a head and a tail via pattern matching) and on\n",
    "which part you'll use the recursive call."
