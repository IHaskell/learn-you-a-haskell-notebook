    "Just kidding! Recursion is actually a way of defining functions in which\n",
    "the function is applied inside its own definition. Definitions in\n",
    "mathematics are often given recursively. For instance, the Fibonacci\n",
    "sequence is defined recursively. First, we define the first two\n",
    "Fibonacci numbers non-recursively. We say that $F(0) = 0$ and\n",
    "$F(1) = 1$, meaning that the 0th and 1st Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1,\n",
    "respectively. Then we say that for any other natural number, that\n",
    "Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers. So\n",
    "$F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$. That way, $F(3)$ is $F(2) + F(1)$, which is\n",
    "$(F(1) + F(0)) + F(1)$. Because we've now come down to only\n",
    "non-recursively defined Fibonacci numbers, we can safely say that $F(3)$\n",
    "is 2. Having an element or two in a recursion definition defined\n",
    "non-recursively (like $F(0)$ and $F(1)$ here) is also called the *edge\n",
    "condition* and is important if you want your recursive function to\n",
    "terminate. If we hadn't defined $F(0)$ and $F(1)$ non recursively, you'd\n",
    "never get a solution any number because you'd reach 0 and then you'd go\n",
    "into negative numbers. All of a sudden, you'd be saying that $F(-2000)$\n",
    "is $F(-2001) + F(-2002)$ and there still wouldn't be an end in sight!\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is important to Haskell because unlike imperative languages,\n",
    "you do computations in Haskell by declaring what something *is* instead\n",
    "of declaring *how* you get it. That's why there are no while loops or\n",
